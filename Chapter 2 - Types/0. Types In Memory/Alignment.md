- dictates where the bytes for a type can be stored.
- all values must start at a byte boundary
- "built-in values are usually aligned to their size" (u8 -> 1 byte, u16 -> 2 byte etc)
	- * up to CPU word size? i128 has alignment of 8 bytes
- Second example here helps solidify how "alignment" and size can be added: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.size_of.html#examples
- the struct A example here shows how the total "size" of a non-primitive type can differ between compilation, depending on where padding is added, for #\[repr(Rust)\]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/repr-rust.html#reprrust
- these resources help explain alignment well:
