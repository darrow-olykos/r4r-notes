- you must provide exactly the given type
- any type that provides mutability is generally **invariant**
- `&mut T` is invariant in `T`.
		- You CANNOT pass `&mut Vec<&'static str>` to something expecting `&mut Vec<&'a str>` .
		- *clarification*: **For the "reason why this isn't allowed: What is a code example of trying to put a short-lived string inside of the Vec?**
- `Cell<T>` is invariant in `T` (`Cell` provides mutability)
