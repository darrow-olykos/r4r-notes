- `std::cell::Cell`
- example of safe [[I.E.1.iii. Interior Mutabiliity]] through invariants.
- not shareable across threads (so inner [[I.A.1. value]] will never be concurrently mutated)
- never gives out reference to the [[I.A.1. value]] contained in the `Cell`
- all methods either replace the [[I.A.1. value]] entirely or return a copy of the contained value
- since no references can exist to its inner [[I.A.1. value]], it is always OK to move it
